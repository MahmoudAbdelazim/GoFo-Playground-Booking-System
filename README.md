# Software Engineering Project
# GoFo Playground Booking System
This project is the final project of the Software Engineering course taught in Cairo university, it's basically a
Playground booking system that is built to handle both players and playground owners' needs. \
The project is divided into 3 Tasks:
## Task 1 - Software Design Specifications
This contains the software design diagrams which include
- UML Class Diagram
- 6 UML Sequence Diagrams
- UI Mockup Designs for the system
## Task 2 - Implementation
This is where the actual coding takes place, and the code is built around the UML Diagrams designed earlier, allowing users to interact with the system using a console UI. \
**The implementation allows playground owners to:**
- Signup/Signin to the system
- Add a playground and wait for approval by admins
- Add the available slots of their playgrounds
- view their current booking, etc. \
**And allows the players to:**
- Signup/Signin to the system
- View the available playgrounds
- Filter playgrounds by specific time slots
- Book a playground
- Create a Team
- Modify their own team, etc.
## Task 3 - Hosting and Documentation
- Documenting the code implemented earlier using JavaDoc and generating the HTML pages for the documentation
